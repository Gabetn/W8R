# ecse428-potatopeeps
Group project for ECSE 428. Our team name is Potato Peeps.

Our project is to create an online food ordering system which provides a platform for the customers to order foods after they have arrived at the restaurant. This system will work on a web browser. Knowledge of the restaurantâ€™s food menu, inventory records and table number will be used.
